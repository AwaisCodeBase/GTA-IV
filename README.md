# 🎮 GTA IV Landing Page

I'm just excited after seeing the **GTA IV trailer** — and that inspiration hit hard!  
So I decided to turn that hype into code and built a **GTA IV Landing Page** using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and smooth **GSAP animations**.

This project is a tribute to the game's legendary style, built with modern frontend technologies to showcase both creativity and coding finesse.
